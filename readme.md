`git diff --cached -  to see the difference in the file from previous version after the file is staged `
`git checkout -b <branch_name> <uid> --<file_name (use * for all files)> - to get the previous version files use -b to make a new brach name and you can then use your branch name to access that version of file easily.`
`git checkout master -  to get back to the latest version of the file you have created`
`git restore <filename or . for all> - to restore the particular file or all files to the latest working version `
`git show <unique-commit-id>- to`

`git reset <--hard><OR><--soft> HEAD^ - this will remove the latest version of the commit and will send you back to the previous version now if you use soft it will just uncommit the version but will keep the data intact but if you use hard it will remove the data too from the file that was changed in the particular version .`
`Using ```--soft``` will uncommit the changes but keep them intact, while ```--hard``` will remove the changes from the working directory as well.`
`git log -p -<number of versions you want to see> - this will help you to check a particular amount of versions from latest to old `
`git log --stat - this is used to get basic summary of the versions.`
`git log --pretty=oneline - to check all the version messages branches and uid in one line .`
`git log --pretty=format:"%h - it was generated %ar by %an  and version is ---->%s" - here %h means hash or the <commit-uid> .`
`%ar-relative time - it is the time of the version was added relative to the time now`
`%an - author name-  to see what is the user.name`
`%s- it is the string or the message you gave while commiting.`

`git log --since=<date>- all the data after the <date>`
`git log --until=<date>- all the data before the <date>`
`git log --author=<name>- to get data of a particular author`
`git log --no-merges- By using git log --no-merges, you filter out these merge commits, giving you a clearer view of the commit history with only the non-merge commits displayed. This can be particularly useful when you're trying to understand the chronological order of changes, track down when specific features or bug fixes were implemented, or simply reviewing the history of a project without the distraction of merge commits.`
`git remote -v - to check if the remote repo  is linked to local repo or not -v is to check which repo is linked to it and it also gives the link to repo`
`git branch - to check all the branches`
`git branch <name_of_branch> -  to create a new branch(use -d flag to delete a branch)`
`git checkout <branch_name>- to get to that branch you have created to specifically work on it.`
`git push - to push the changes from local machine to the remote repo`
`git pull - to get the changes from remote repo to local repo`
`git push origin <branch_name> -to push a branch to github`
`git merge <name of the branch to merge>-it will add the changes from the branch to the main branch.`
`git clean <-i or -f or -n> - us this command to remove the untracked files -i for different commands and filters and -f to delete all and -n to show all the files that are going to be deleted`
`git tag -a <name_of_tag> -m <message_for_tag> <commit_uid>-  this will create an easy name for the commit uids that can be accessed without using uid and instad using the tagname assigned to that version.`
`git push --tags or git push origin --tags - it will push it to remote repo `
`when a file is not tracked it is untracked then when we do git add then it goes to the staging area then when we commit the file then it gets tracked `
